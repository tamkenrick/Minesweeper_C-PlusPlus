# Minesweeper_C-PlusPlus
Minesweeper_C-PlusPlus is the fist C++ project I had developed after I had finished learning C++.

Game Rules:
Dig all the non-mine cells

Functions:
1) A random generate map
2) Number indicating the number of nearby mine
3) Empty cells (If users dig a empty cell it will detect and open nearby empty cell)
